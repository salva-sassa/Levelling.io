## 1. Project Overview
- **Project Name:** Multiplayer 2D Game with Adaptable Game Mechanics
- **Technologies:** React (UI), Express or Nest (Backend), WebSocket (for game sessions), 2D Game Engine (e.g., Phaser.js)
- **Description:** A foundational game project where the backend serves a main menu. The WebSocket connection is initiated only when a player clicks "Join Game," allowing for future expansion of game mechanics including physics-based combat, upgrades, and ranking systems.

## 2. Backend Server Development
### 2.1 Initial Server Setup
- Set up an Express or Nest server.
- Serve the main menu along with static or dynamic content.
- Create API endpoints to support user interactions such as viewing the menu.

### 2.2 Menu System
- Develop a clear and engaging menu interface.
- Ensure the menu handles initial user requests without requiring a WebSocket connection.
- Prepare the backend to handle the transition when a user chooses to join a game.

## 3. Frontend Development
### 3.1 React Application Setup
- Initialize the React project.
- Design and implement the main menu UI that interacts with the backend.
- Ensure the UI is responsive and intuitive, offering options like "Join Game."

### 3.2 Game Engine Integration
- Integrate a 2D game engine (e.g., Phaser.js) within the React framework.
- Establish a game canvas component where the actual game will be rendered once the player joins.

## 4. Transition to Multiplayer Game Session
### 4.1 WebSocket Integration (Upon Joining Game)
- Implement a WebSocket connection that is activated when the player clicks "Join Game."
- Set up event listeners for connection management, including handling errors and disconnections.
- Ensure a smooth transition from the menu to the active game session.

## 5. Game Foundation and Future Adaptability
### 5.1 Core Game Mechanics Foundation
- Represent players with simple visual elements (e.g., circles).
- Implement basic movement and positioning mechanics.
- Develop a modular codebase to facilitate future additions such as:
  - A physics-based combat system (starting with a simple gun mechanism)
  - Resource collection or farming systems to upgrade weapons and abilities
  - A scoring and ranking system for tracking player performance

### 5.2 Extendable Architecture
- Structure your code to allow for easy integration of new features.
- Document coding guidelines and best practices to support future enhancements and modifications.

## 6. Testing, Optimization, and Deployment
### 6.1 Testing and Quality Assurance
- Conduct unit and integration tests on both backend and frontend components.
- Test the menu functionality and the WebSocket connection process.
- Monitor performance, focusing on latency and smooth transitions between game states.

### 6.2 Deployment Strategy
- Set up deployment pipelines for both backend and frontend services.
- Implement monitoring, logging, and error tracking to ensure stability and scalability.
